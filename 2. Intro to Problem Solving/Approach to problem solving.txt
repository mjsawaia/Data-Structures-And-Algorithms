What is an algorithm? - Process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

Devise a plan for solving problems:
1. Understand the problem
    - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    - What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
    - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (do i have enough info)
    - How to label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem. 
2. Explore Concrete Examples
    - Start with simple examples
    - Progerss to more complex examples
    - Edge cases - invalid or empty inpust
3. Break It Down
    - Write down the steps you need to take
    - pseudo code or written instructions for what you need to do
4. Solve/Simplify
    - solve the problem if you can - if you cant, solve a simpler problem. 
    - find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - write a simplified solution
    - then incorporate that difficulty back in
5. Look Back and Refactor
    - Can you check the result?
    - Can you derive the result differently?
    - can you understand it at a glance?
    - Can yo use the result or method for some other problem?
    - Can you improve the performance?
    - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    - How have other people solved this problem?
