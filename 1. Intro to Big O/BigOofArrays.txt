Ordered lists - use when you need order
when you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of...)

Insertion & Removal - adding to beginning causes reindexing of all elements. 
    .push()/.pop() = O(1)
    .shift()/.unshift() = O(N)
Searching - O(N)
Access - O(1)

Built in Array Methods:
concat - O(N)
slice - O(N)
splice - O(N)
sort - O(N * log N)
forEach/map/filter/reducer etc. - O(N)

really just think about whether or not it will cause reindexing of the array. if so, likely O(N) (except sorting). if not, likely O(1)
